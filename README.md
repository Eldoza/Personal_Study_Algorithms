# Personal Study Algorithms

- This repo is a collection of various classical algorithm computer science problems that I have solved in Ruby. Most of these folders also contain Rspec tests, as I try to follow TDD practices in all of my coding projects.

- If you clone this repo, please make sure to install Rspec prior to running any tests. You can do so by running the following in the terminal:
```
bundle install
```

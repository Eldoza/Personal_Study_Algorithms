# Personal Study Algorithms

- This repo is a collection of various classical algorithm computer science problems and problems I have found on Codewars that I have solved in Ruby and Javascript. I have attempted to write Rspec and Jasmine tests for as many of these as possible. This is still a work in progress and will continue to add to this repo as I can. Please feel free to add any of your favorite problems :)

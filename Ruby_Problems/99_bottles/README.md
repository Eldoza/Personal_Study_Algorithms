*Figure 1*.  Text of the song 99 Bottles of Beer.

Ah, the good old [99 Bottles of Beer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99_Bottles_of_Beer) song (see Figure 1).  Are we familiar with the song?

We're going to model someone singing this song by writing a method which produces the lyrics for the entire song.  We'll write a method `bottle_song_lyrics`, and in our virtual beer hall, calling `bottle_song_lyrics(99)` represents asking our rowdy neighbor to start singing 99 Bottles of Beer.

The verses of this song are all very similarâ€”at least, until there's only one bottle of beer on the wall.  As we can imagine, this challenge deals with handling repetition.

The solutions here were written iteratively and recursively.
